> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am working on a BIG project, that will allow users to customize their cards however they wish, I am still working on making it actually work, then I'll make it nice looking and release for beta because holy moly it is gonna be crazyyyyy.
> One thing to note, this project will be deprecated after it's successor, but will still be online regardless, trust me, I've been working on it for 2 months now and it is taking a really good shape.

This generates customizable cards displaying osu! profile statistics in multiple formats including SVG, PNG, and JPG. Customize the cards' appearance, play mode preferences, and output format through our [website](https://osu-profile-stats.vercel.app/editor), and embed them directly into your osu! profile with BBCode, README files or website.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can create a card at our website so you can have an easier time [here!](https://osu-profile-stats.vercel.app/editor)
>
> I'll be making some updates to the editor from time to time to make it better!

> [!NOTE]
> I've removed URL parameter instructions on this version of the README, but you can still find instructions for it [here.](https://github.com/Luis-Tanese/osu-profile-stats/blob/main/OLD_README.md)
>
> Reason I've removed it is because doing through the website is much more convenient _(Plus I spent a lot of time on the frontend of the editor XD)_.
>
> Also the old readme will still stay up-to-date with the current API, so no worries on that end.
>
> And no, I didn't copy [osu-stats-signature](https://github.com/solstice23/osu-stats-signature). Our codebases are way different, since I made mine from the ground up, plus I made sure that EVERY feature I have works.
