This generates SVG cards displaying osu! profile statistics. Customize the cards' appearance and play mode preferences through our [website](https://osu-profile-stats.vercel.app/editor.html), and embed them directly into your osu! profile with BBCode, README files or website.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can create a card at our website so you can have an easier time [here!](https://osu-profile-stats.vercel.app/editor.html)
> I'll be making some updates to the editor from time to time to make it better!

> [!NOTE]
> I've removed URL parameter instructions on this version of the README, but you can still find instructions for it [here.]()
> Reason I've removed it is because doing through the website is much more convenient (Plus I spent a lot of time on the frontend of the editor XD).
> Also the old readme will still stay up-to-date with the current API, so no worries on that end.
